  By the end of the 90’s skateparks had begun to pop up everywhere and many
of them were free to use like public parks.

  However many if not all skaters are still always on the lookout for new 
places to skate and do tricks. What most people see as stairs or handrails,
benches or embankments skateboarders see as obstacles to be conquered and 
do tricks on. It’s so pervasive a part of the urban environment that most 
architecture and engineering also includes deterrents to skateboarders and
skateboard related wear and tear.

  This is where Ska8Tool comes in. We’ve provided a database where 
 skateboarders can share and look up spots to skate at.
```

### Project Description

```md
  You could find baseball and softball fields everywhere as well as soccer 
fields, basketball and tennis courts. Skateboarding and skateboarders 
however were relegated to finding their own places to practice and do tricks.
The skateparks that did exist cost money to use and required waivers and pads 
to even walk into while not providing a wide array of obstacles to use.
```

### Usage

1. Main page: Input search city and look for the park, shop, weather, and view the spots in the database
